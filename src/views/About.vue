    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As funny as it sounds, my career in web development started with a game.
      It was winter of 2018, and I was bored and jobless (promise, it's not
      another deadbeat story, I just wasn't able to obtain my work permit at the
      time). Anyways, I was scrolling through the Internet trying to find
      something to do and absolutely randomly found
      <a
        href="https://codecombat.com/"
      >this web-game</a> where you move your
      character by writing pieces of code in Python. It just so happened that at
      the time the creators of the game released additional paid levels, which
      were teaching players the basics of HTML programming. My curiosity won
      over my snobbish nature, and I dove deep into a funny small tutorial. I
      couldn't even imagine that a timekiller for a day would turn into a
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fell in love with web development and in a short time found myself
      devouring HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses on
      <a
        href="https://www.edx.org/"
      >Edx</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> (I'm leaving
      links here not for advertising purposes, but as starting point for those
      who would like a starting point. All of the resources are absolutely
      free). My excitement and devotion to my new hobby was so deep and powerful
      that I made an important life decision afterwards, I decided to do
      whatever it takes to become a web developer. Shortly after I found myself
      a student of Web Development Immersive program in the
      <a
        href="https://generalassemb.ly/"
      >General Assembly</a> school.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a constant fight with myself about what was more important to me:
      my knowledge, career, success, happiness or the need to relax and
      procrastinate. I would be lying if I said that I didn&#39;t get
      discouraged at times. Sometimes I felt lost and sometimes – absolutely
      imposturous. But as any developer, I just couldn&#39;t give up the feeling
      of exuberance every time I solved the problem (developers&#39; high is
      real!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the time I graduated school I discovered another absolutely amazing
      resource for self-learners –
      <a
        href="https://www.udemy.com/"
      >Udemy</a>, which became my Netflix 24/7.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am still learning, but this sums of my progress so far. I fell in love
      with programming because with all its constant changes, it gave me an
      opportunity to tame my thirst for knowledge. I fell in love with many
      wonderfully people I met in this amazing community, forever dreamers,
      and(delete) go-getters, and life-changers. And(delete) Best of all I was
      finally able to find the feeling of accomplishment that I have been
      craving for so long.
      <br />
      <br />The End!
      <br />
      <br />P.S. I am currently going through C# and .NET at
      the
      <a
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/"
      >Microsoft .NET documentation website</a>
      to add yet another skill to my vast skillset!
